    <h2>Evolution of the eight family groups</h2>
    <p>
      When the people of Befang settled at Uwong, during the reign of

      {' '}
      {' '}
      from Uko-mandzang, there were initially five family groups
      which are the Kibien (the first 5 in the list above). In those days, there were
      inter-tribal wars, and the people of Befang were often humiliated and defeated by
      the people of Mukuru village who always fought and seized the hunted animals by the
      Befang people. They (Befang people) then resorted to seek external
      help from Ketsm Utum (Ketsm is spelled today as Ketchem).
      Ketsm Utum was a stranger who lived on the
      hills of Zonghoh and had three sons namely Katche, Bezeng, and Aleh. Ketsm Utum decided to
      offer his three sons to fortify the Befang worriors. During a subsequent encounter
      with the Mukuru people, the Befang people defeated them for the first time and for all.
      Thanks to Ketsm Utum!!!

      After this victory, Ketsm Utum wanted to leave, but the people of Befang
      wanted him to stay.
      They needed him for protection, and in order to make him stay, they decided to make a great
      offer which was the transfer of power and surrender of chieftency to
      Ketsm Utum&apos;s family - Buo-ketsm.
    </p>
    <p>
      This move now gave birth to the last three family groups resulting from the three
      sons of Ketsm Utum namely: Buo-katche, Buo-bezeng, and Buo-leh representing Katche, Bezeng,
      and Aleh respectively, with
      {' '}

      {' '}
      as their new chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      This move was not welcomed by all, particularly the Uko-mandzang people.
      Majority of the indigens from Uko-mandzang did not want to be
      ruled by another leader, and as a show of protest, they migrated along with
      Mangawa and created their own village which is present day Okomanjang.
