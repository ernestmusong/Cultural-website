    <p>
      Ubog is the second place where the people of Befang settled after Uwong.
      The first person to settle here was a woman who found the place to be safe.
      She then informed others who were still living at Uwong, and that&apos;s how people
      gradually started leaving Uwong to settle here. The last couple left Uwong
      around 1998 and did not settle at Ubog.
